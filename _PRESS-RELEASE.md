Adam Lessen's MVP: Rent Krunch

<!--

There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Rent Krunch 

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  Anyone living in SF or thining of living in SF can see the historical trends in record rent prices, where their rent lies in the trend, and what year they would have had to move to SF to pay what they ideally would like in SF. They then just need to build a time machine :) 

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  Very easily see and understand the trend of rent prices in SF. Make a profile to save your rent and target rent and find out the year you should have moved to SF! 

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Understanding how rents got to be so damn high! It's very hard to gain context about why exactly rent is so high in our city.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Seeing trends over time demystifies how we got to the current day situation because it provides context. We can feel slightly better knowing that once upon a time, rents were reasonable!


## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  Every other conversation in SF already pertains to rent prices in some way, now we can vizualize it at least! 

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Just visit our page to see the historical data! Create an account and log in to get personalized information! 

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "I felt so helpless before Rent Krunch. I had no idea why my rent was so damn high! Now I understand the trends and know I should have really moved here in 1980. Sorry for partying!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
